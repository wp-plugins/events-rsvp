Easily create an RSVP form and manage registrations

== Description ==

Events RSVP is a plugin to create RSVP forms for events and manage registrations.

Events are created from a custom menu in the admin and integrated to the website
thanks to a custom widget, located in the widget menu.

Users can:

* Register for the event
* Register for the waiting list if the max registration limit has been reached
* Receive confirmation emails after successful registration for the event or
for the waiting list

Admin can:

* See the list of people registered for the event and for the waiting list
* Modify the max registration limit
* Cancel any registration

== Installation ==

**Plugin Installation**

1. Install ERSVP via WordPress.org plugin directory
2. Activate the plugin

Congrats, the plugin is now active !

**Configuration**

To display a registration form in the front end, you need to:

1. Create an event
2. Setup the Event Registration Widget

1. Create an event
  * Go to the `Events` menu, then click on the `Add New` sub-menu
  * Create a new event with a title, max registrations limit (how many people can register) and date
2. Setup the Event Registration widget
  * Go to Widgets menu 
  * In the `Available Widgets` pane, you should see a new widget called `Events Registration`
  * Drag and drop this widget to one of the widget area of your theme, on the right-hand side (sometime called sidebar)
  * Click on the down arrow of the widget to expand it
  * Set the title that will appear on the front-end
  * select the event you want from the drop-down list
  * Click on Save

Congrats, you have just setup your first event !
You just need to refresh the page where the widget area or sidebar is active, and you should see the event registration form.

Optionally, you can also configure the emails sent to users upon registration for the event or for the waiting list.
For this, go to the Events menu, then Settings sub-menu, and you will find the relevant settings.
